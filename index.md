# -gr's website

I'm [@-gr](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-gr/) on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and I love to code. I have a raspberry pi and many computers that I like to experiment with code on. 

### Which languages do I know?

I know markdown (if you can count that), Scratch (of course), and a tiny bit of HTML and Javascript.
